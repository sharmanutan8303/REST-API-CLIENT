# Task Description: Java Application for Fetching and Displaying API Data
  Develop a Java application that interacts with a public REST API, such as OpenWeatherMap, to fetch and display structured data. The application should send HTTP requests, retrieve JSON responses, and extract key    details for display.

# Requirements:
  Use Java's HttpURLConnection or an HTTP client like OkHttp to make API requests.
  Parse JSON responses using org.json or JSON-Simple.
  Handle errors (e.g., invalid city names, network issues).
  Display the fetched data in a clear format (console output or a GUI).
  Ensure code readability and maintainability.

# Expected Outcome:
  A functional Java application that fetches data (e.g., weather details) from an API, processes it, and presents it in a structured format.
